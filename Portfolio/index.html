                    <p>

                        I would describe myself as a hardworking, self-taught developer who has competent proficiency in
                        Java and Python. I have experience in both app and web development. I did my schooling in India
                        and came to Ireland to pursue my undergrad degree in CS from
                        Dublin City University. Leadership is something that I feel comes naturally to me - I am the
                        first-year representative for both Enactus DCU and the Indian Society. I love teaching others
                        how to program and have always believed
                        in the upliftment of others with me so I spend my free time teaching kids at CoderDojo how to
                        program. I am extremely passionate about helping others get into computer science because of the
                        misconception that some may have about
                        what it actually is. In the future, I would love to be known as a tech leader who helps others
                        realize their true potential.<br><b>Find me at: </b><span class="links"><a
